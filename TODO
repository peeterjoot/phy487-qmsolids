- for kdp version disabled the plots in chapter 1 from problem 2.  that disable is hard coded -- now reverted.

   Can I fix up the figures so they aren't so large/complicated, and include in print version?

- 
   159  5.48 -- mathlabelbox still looks off

- margin overflow:

   pg 183. Table 6.1: Blochâ€™s theorem spelled.
        -- how to make the first column narrower, so that the others have more space?

Figures:
        42. Figure 2.19: reciprocal projection. -- transparency seems off.
        230 Figure 6.45: Effective mass for 3D cubic system.
           axis labels too strong.

re-work labels in mathematica.
       157. Figure 5.19: Fermi-Dirac distribution -- y-axis label too big.
       162. Figure 5.27: -- y-axis label too big.
       163. Figure 5.28: Screened vs unscreened Coulomb -- Can't read labels

   regenerate with style thick -- will need internet connection.

- duplication of stuff in the index
