This book contains my lecture notes for the Winter 2013, University of Toronto Condensed Matter Physics course (PHY487H1F), taught by Prof. Stephen Julian.

Official course description:

   "Introduction to the concepts used in the modern treatment of solids.  The student is assumed to be familiar with elementary quantum mechanics.  Topics include:  bonding in solids, crystal structures, lattice vibrations, free electron model of metals, band structure, thermal properties, magnetism and superconductivity (time permitting)"

This book contains:

- Plain old lecture notes.   These mirror what was covered in class, possibly augmented with additional details.
- Personal notes exploring details that were not clear to me from the lectures, or from the texts associated with the lecture material.
- Assigned problems.  Like anything else take these as is.  I have attempted to either correct errors or mark them as such.
- Some worked problems attempted as course prep, for fun, or for test preparation, or post test reflection.
- Links to Mathematica workbooks associated with this course.
