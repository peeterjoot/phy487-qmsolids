%This is an ungraded set of answers to the problems posed.

%\begin{center}
%{\bf PHY 487/1487 Problem Set \# 5} \\
%Due Friday Oct.\ 18 by 4:30 p.m., MP324 \\
%\end{center}

%Note 1: I will be away from the University on Thursday and Friday, so if you
%have questions you will have to send email to
%{\em sjulian@physics.utoronto.ca}.  I apologize for any inconvenience.
%The lecture on Friday the 18th will be given by Professor Young-June Kim,
%and assignments can be submitted to him.
%
%Note 2:  This problem set will be graded and returned by Monday,
% 21 October at 2:00 p.m., so late assignments will not be accepted beyond
% that time.  If you have a valid medical or personal excuse, and
% cannot submit the problem set by that time, I will ignore this
% problem set in calculating your final mark.
%
%Note 3:
%Collaboration is encouraged, but direct copying is not: make sure you
%understand your solutions.  (At least some exam questions will be
%based closely on problem set questions.)
